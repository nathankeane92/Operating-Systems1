An operating sytem's function is to run applications. It does this by saving information onto it's memory so that you can customize the app. 
When you open it again, it saves your progress. 
Another function of an operating system could be to run an application like a camera.
It uses the hardware on the phone to input data from that hardware.
That hardware is a camera, inputting data such as pictures onto the system..
A third function of an OS is to save files. 
You can input files by using a keyboard and writing notes and saving a picutre you took with the camera.
It saves it to memory, and pulls up the file, with the notes and pictures saved, and also your app preferences saved.
